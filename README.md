# Weather-Dashboard

# Description
In this Challenge, I'll be creating an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.

* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
- The city name
- The date
 - An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity
- The wind speed

* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
- The date
- An icon representation of weather conditions
- The temperature
- The humidity

* When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
